# Save Net Neutrality!

The head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai used to be a lawyer for Verizon and now he is making key decisions about the future of the Internet! Join one of the nation-wide protests outside a Verizon store. One is happening on Thurs Dec 7 at the store between Durham and Chapel Hill on 15-501! http://verizonprotests.com/

Two years ago, FCC classified the Internet as a Title II service, categorizing it as a public service like electricity or water. This primarily ensured:

- No Blocking: 		Internet Service Providers (ISP) may not block access to legal content
- No Throttling:		ISPs may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic
- No Paid Prioritization:	ISPs may not throttle websites because they haven’t paid a fee.

For example, if Verizon doesn’t like a particular political website, they are not allowed to throttle connections to that website (restrict the amount of data a user can send/retrieve from the server).

The head of the FCC, Ajit Pai, has proposed eliminating these protections and giving all regulatory powers to ISPs. Comcast and Spectrum would be able to decide if they want to throttle websites or have paid prioritization.

This proposal will be brought up at the FCC December open meeting on December 14th. 3 out of 5 FCC Members are required to pass this. 2 are expected to vote against, and 3 for. Michael O’Rielley has voted against similar proposals in the past, but he seems more persuadable than Ajit Pai or Brendon Carr. Read about Michael O’Reilley here.
