# Cryptography Crash Course

### Sitterson 011 Monday, Jan 29, 18:00-20:00

Come learn about hashing, symmetric and asymmetric encryption, authentication and how/where they are used. Blockchain or quantum crypto may be touched at the end if time permits. Come with any cryptography questions, technical or career related!  

Little to no programming knowledge required, but it will help.  

Food will be provided.
