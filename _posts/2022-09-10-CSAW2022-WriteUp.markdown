The following are writeups of challenges solved from CSAW 2022.

## Quantum Leap
Challenge: My friend took the quantum leap and purchased a quantum computer with two qubits. They mentioned using a quantum logic gate to input the flag and they gave me the computer's output. I have been stuck and Can NOT figure out the flag.

Scrambled flag: wxqvn$Zae${deyZv$d"i

#### Important Info:
* Quantum computer with two qubits
* Flag was passed through a quantum logic gate
* "Can NOT" makes me believe the flag was input through a CNOT gate

#### Qubits and gates
* Classical bits are 0 or 1
* Qubits can be 0, 1 or some state in-between
* The message is stored with classical bits (0, 1), so first we start by converting the message into binary
    * Message in binary: 011101110111100001110001011101100110111000100100010110100110000101100101001001000111101101100100011001010111100101011010011101100010010001100100001000100100100100001010
  
* Since we know the quantum computer has two qubits, we can group the bits into pairs of two, where the first bit in each pair represents the first qubit's state and the second bit represents the second qubit's state

#### CNOT gate
Since the flag was (probably) passed through a CNOT gate, we can reverse this by applying another CNOT gate to the flag. The CNOT gate is a two-qubit operation that flips the state of the second qubit if the first qubit state is 1. So, we can cycle through each pair of bits and "apply" the CNOT gate by flipping value (0 -> 1 or 1 -> 0) of the second bit if the first bit is a 1.

##### Applying the CNOT gate
* For each pair of bits:
    * If the first qubit is a 1, flip the value of the second qubit
    * Otherwise, don't change the values of the pair

#### Possible Solutions
* Python: described below
* Numpy/Linear Algebra: represent qubits as matrices and apply the CNOT gate using matrix multiplication
* Use online binary converter and flip bits by hand

#### Python Solution Structure
* Convert the scrambled flag into binary (use Python or an online converter)
* Split the binary string into paris of two bits
    * E.g. 00101101 -> 00, 10, 11, 01
* Iterate through the pairs of bits
    * If the first bit is a 1, then flip the value of the second bit
    * Otherwise, don't change the values of the bits

#### Python Code
```
# Read text from output file 
with open('output') as f:
  enc_flag = f.readlines()

# Convert the encoded flag from a list to a string
enc_flag = "".join(enc_flag)
print(enc_flag)

# Convert encoded flag to binary (no spaces)
enc_flag_bin = "".join(f"{ord(letter):08b}" for letter in enc_flag)


def break_pairs(s):
  # Split the binary into pairs of bits
  list_string = []
  # Loop over string and append a letter, every other time (determined by counter),
  # append a space
  count = 1
  string_to_append = ""

  for l in s:
    string_to_append += l
    if len(string_to_append) == 2:
      list_string.append(string_to_append)
      string_to_append = ""

  return list_string

encoded_pairs = break_pairs(enc_flag_bin)


def CNOT(pairs):
  """If first bit is 1, flip the value of the second bit"""

  new_pairs = []

  for pair in pairs:
    pair_to_append = ""
    if pair[0] == '1':
      flipped_second = '0'
      if pair[1] == '0':
        flipped_second = '1'

      pair_to_append += pair[0]
      pair_to_append += flipped_second

    else:
      pair_to_append = pair
    new_pairs.append(pair_to_append)
    

  return new_pairs

print(encoded_pairs)

# Apply the CNOT gate to the pairs
cnot_pairs = CNOT(encoded_pairs)
print(cnot_pairs)

# Convert pairs into a single string
final_binary = "".join(cnot_pairs)

print(final_binary)

def bitstring_to_bytes(s):
  return int(s, 2).to_bytes((len(s) + 7) // 8, byteorder='big')

# Convert binary into text for the flag!
flag = bitstring_to_bytes(final_binary).decode('ascii')

print(flag)
```
