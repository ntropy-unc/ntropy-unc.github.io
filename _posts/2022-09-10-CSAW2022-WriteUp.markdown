The following are writeups of challenges solved from CSAW 2022.

### Quantum Leap
Challenge: My friend took the quantum leap and purchased a quantum computer with two qubits. They mentioned using a quantum logic gate to input the flag and they gave me the computer's output. I have been stuck and Can NOT figure out the flag.

##### Important Info:
* Quantum computer with two qubits
* Flag was input through a quantum logic gate
* "Can NOT" makes me believe the flag was input through a CNOT gate

### Our Spy In New Terrain (OSINT)
